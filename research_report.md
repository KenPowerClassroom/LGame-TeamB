### What is the purpose of this document
### Why are we doing this project

## Game description
The L game is a two-player game played on a 4x4 board of squares. Each player has a 3x2 L-shaped piece, and there are two 1x1 neutral pieces.

## Game rules
Each player must move their L-shaped piece by flipping it, rotating it, or translating it, to a new legal position (It mus be within the bounds of the board, and must not be overlapping another game piece.)
They may then optionally move one neutral 1x1 piece to an unoccupied position. The game is won when your opponent can no longer make a legal move.
