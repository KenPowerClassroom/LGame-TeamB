# The L-Game Research report 
## Introduction
We are second year games development students trying to create a game using test driven development (TDD) to improve our ability as game developers and our team working skills.

### What is the purpose of this document
This document is here to inform about what we are trying to make and the team that is making it.

### Why are we doing this project
We wish to challenge our ability to design a game using the agile methodoligy and improve our team working skills.

## Game description
The L game is a two-player game played on a 4x4 board of squares. Each player has a 3x2 L-shaped piece, and there are two 1x1 neutral pieces.

## Game rules
Each player must move their L-shaped piece by flipping it, rotating it, or translating it, to a new legal position (It mus be within the bounds of the board, and must not be overlapping another game piece.)
They may then optionally move one neutral 1x1 piece to an unoccupied position. The game is won when your opponent can no longer make a legal move.

## Playing strategies
One strategy that is widely used in the L-game is to try and get your piece and the neutral piece to occupy a 3 by 3 block and use the last neutral piece to block the player from creating a mirror image of your L-piece and that will result in a win. People usually try and out the neutral piece into one of the eight 'Killer spaces', these spaces are on the edge of the board but not in a corner. it really helps block off a lot of the board making it harder for the player to move anywhere.
